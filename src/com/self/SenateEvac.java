 * A small fire started in the senate room, and it needs to be evacuated!
 *   There are some senators in the senate room, each of whom belongs to of one of N political parties.
 *   Those parties are named after the first N (uppercase) letters of the English alphabet.
 *   The emergency door is wide enough for up to two senators, so in each step of the evacuation,
 *      you may choose to remove either one or two senators from the room.
 *   The senate rules indicates, senators in the room may vote on any bill at any time, even in the middle of an evac!
 *   So, the senators must be evacuated in a way that ensures that no party ever has an absolute majority.
 *   That is, it can never be the case after any evacuation step that more than half of the senators
 *      in the senate room belong to the same party. Can you construct an evacuation plan ?
